## DEVOPS TERMS

### DevOps Engineer
The person capable of building and setting up the architecture and infrastructure of the project. (Hopefully you, by the end of this course.)

### Agile
Agile refers to iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. Remember, Agile is not a
buzzword like “synergy.” It is a set of tangible practices.

### Scrum
Scrum is a subset of Agile,. It’s a process framework for agile development, and the most
widely-used one. Further, it is characterized by a set of roles, ceremonies (like development
Sprints) and artifacts. The Scrum framework creates the environment where teams can
become Agile.

### Kanban
Kanban refers to a means to design, manage, and improve flow for knowledge work. It also
allows organizations to start with their existing workflow, and drive evolutionary change.
Kanban helps visualize an existing flow of work, limit work in progress (WIP), and stop
starting and start finishing.

### Continuous Testing
Continuous testing executes automated test cases as part of the build process. The software
development team is immediately alerted to potential issues so they are able to address
them before it gets out into production.

### Regression Testing
Regression testing is end-to-end testing of an application to ensure that any modifications
have not negatively impacted its functionality.

### Pipeline
Pipelines are used to automate the build and testing of code, while also making it available
to other users. Pipelines can work with just about any language or project type. They
combine continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to constantly and
consistently test, build, and ship code to any target.

### CI/CD
Continuous Integration refers to catching bugs or issues early in the development cycle,
when they're easier and faster to fix.
Continuous Delivery automatically deploys and tests code from the CI process. Working in
conjunction, these practices produce deployable artifacts.

### Artifact
An artifact is a deployable component of your application. Pipelines can deploy artifacts that
are produced by a wide range of artifact sources, and that are stored in different types of
artifact repositories.

### Repo
Azure Repos (i.e. repositories) is a set of **version control** tools you can use to manage code.
**Version control systems** help you track changes you make in your code over time. As you
edit your code, you tell the version control system to take a snapshot of your files. The
version control system saves that snapshot permanently so you can recall it later. Use version
control to save your work and coordinate code changes across your team.
The most commonly used version control system today is called **Git**. It is quickly becoming
the standard for version control.
